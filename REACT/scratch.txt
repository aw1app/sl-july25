//NEW USER
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"David\",\"email\":\"david@example.com\",\"phone\":\"456-789-0123\"}"
 

//UPDATE USER (FULL UPDATE)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/users/8f7a -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"New David\",\"email\":\"newdavid@example.com\",\"phone\":\"167-890-1234\"}"

// PARTIAL update
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/users/8f7a -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\":\"New David 2\"}"

 Q: will we be exploring having multiple sets of data in a single JSON? 
 Like another set of key:values for Managers instead of just Users,
  then another for maybe Articles for the website? and how to pull just the info we want>?


  what prevents any random user from using something like postman to update our directly to our live server?

  do the JSON databases like MongoDB support object-relational mapping and relationships between objects?  (parent-child, etc?)
  ORM - yes
  relationships between objects - yes
